## Style guide

I used some patterns that I believe that is a good approach.

- For styles, I followed the ITCSS & RSCSS pattern.

- On javascript I mixed up some concepts of OOP and functional. I point 
to the *Store* which was I built with Facade Design to isolate the LocalStorage.

- The Grid System was created by myself but I didn't use them.


## Database

I used LocalStorage because is easy to use and support the necessity
